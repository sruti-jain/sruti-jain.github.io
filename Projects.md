- **[INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION & CHART USING D3](http://srutisj.in/Interactive%20Visualization%20&%20Analysis%20Chart%20using%20D3/InteractiveVisualization.html)** - My goal of this visualization was to show how, most of the world's population has seen an increase in body size with an increase in food supply, and show how this compares to how "rich" a country is.

This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also [**available for consulting**](), so feel free to [contact me]() if it looks like we could work together.
