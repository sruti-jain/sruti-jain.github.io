**Cloud Computing** is internet based computing practice using a network of remote servers hosted to store information and are provided on demand, like the electricity grid. It basically consist of the concept that your computing power is delivered over the Internet, as opposed to from your local desktop or server. So the computing power is in “the cloud”, and typically, accessible by others. You have the notion of a “private cloud”, which are basically your LAN and classic client-server architecture. It is relatively a recent term that builds on decades of research in virtualization, distributed computing, utility computing and more recently networking, web and software services. It implies a service oriented architecture, reduced information technology overhead for the end-user, great flexibility, reduced total cost of ownership, on-demand services and many more. The applications of cloud computing is in and around the whole economy and technical aspects of the world. It can be rightly summed up that cloud computing is the most happening technology that will grip the world very fast presently.
