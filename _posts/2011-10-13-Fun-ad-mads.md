Crazy fun. We had â€˜Ad Madsâ€™ competition today in college. Many of us just wondered is this just what the names suggest. And to our surprise yes it was somewhat related.

It was an event organized by the management branch of our university as part of their extra-curricular wherein they organized this event in 3-phases. There was an enthusiastic participation from all the members in the college which counted down to 60 three member team for round one.

Round one was plain. They gave us the name of some product or brand and we had to tell the brand-ambassadorâ€™s name who acted in the advertisement. To my surprise my friend Reema watched I guess only advertisement on the TV and we very smoothly moved to the second round.

Second round was to tell the tagline of the product they gave. Taglines like â€˜Whatâ€™s your style!â€™, â€˜The Ultimate Driving Machineâ€™, â€˜Because Iâ€™m worth itâ€™ were astonishing but it was great fun to even guess the answers as we didnâ€™t know the majority of them. But I guess our guess were stronger than others and we cleared round two. ![ðŸ˜›](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png)

The third round was interesting of all. One person of the team have to enact the product & brand, while the other two have to guess it. Difficult when you havenâ€™t seen the advertisement even once, but fun.

Though we couldnâ€™t win the final round it was a day full of fun and was a enriching experience.
